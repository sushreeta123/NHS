The NHS Data Project aimed to gather and utilize data from general practitioners (GPs) to improve healthcare planning and research across the UK. The goal was to create a centralized and comprehensive database that would contain health-related information from GP practices, allowing researchers and policymakers to access valuable insights to improve healthcare services, conduct medical research, and better understand various health conditions and treatments.

Data Collection: The project involved collecting health data from patients registered at GP practices. This data included information on diagnoses, treatments, medications, test results, and other health-related details.
Anonymized and Pseudonymized Data: To protect patient privacy, the collected data was anonymized or pseudonymized. Anonymization removes identifiable information, such as names and addresses, while pseudonymization replaces identifying details with unique codes.
Research and Planning: The primary purpose of the NHS Data Project was to support medical research and healthcare planning. Researchers could access the aggregated data to study health trends, disease prevalence, treatment outcomes, and other health-related factors.
